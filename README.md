# External APIs - Choose your own adventure!

To get started: 

* Clone this repo

```sh
cd consuming-external-apis
npm install
npm run dev
```

Choose an API to work with, and let's get building! Find your own, or check out this [comprehensive list of options](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

There is a basic API route set up for you - you may wish to use this as a template.

## Things to remember
* Create the functions that make your API calls in `client/api.js`, and call those functions within your React components.
* If you choose an API that enforces CORS, you'll need to consume that API from your server-side, and consume your own API from the client-side.
